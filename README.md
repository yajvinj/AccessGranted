# AccessGranted

The Access Granted Project is an application that takes input from a user in the form of a fingerprint attached to a ring and performs 
a specific task chosen by the user. The user choses an application of their choice on the android app. This app implements the model of a
student iClicker, a morse code to text converter, and can be used to make calls to a number with one tap on the fingerprint sensor. 
We used an Arduino Uno to implement the hardware, and Android Studio (Java, XML) to implement the android app.
